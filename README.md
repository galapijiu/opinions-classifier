opinions-classifier
===================

This is small attempt to create application which analyzes real-time stream of data (via twitter streaming API) and clustering different posts according to their meaning.

Various clustering algorithms are planned to be tested as part of this app.

One of the approaches is using Lingo algorithms from [carrot2](https://github.com/carrot2/carrot2)

Also web-based interface is proposed to observe real-time clusters fluctuations.
