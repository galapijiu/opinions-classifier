opinions-classifier
===================

This is small attempt to create application which analyzes real-time stream of data (via twitter streaming API) and clusters different posts according to their meaning. It is planned to use for grouping tweets in real-time and to visualize trends in observed topic.

Various clustering algorithms are planned to be tested as part of this app.

The goal of this project is to create miningfull clustering for strwam information and visualize it accordingly.

See discussion regarding possible algorithms to use is on stackoverflow here: http://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/979/algorithms-for-text-clustering

One of the approaches is using Lingo algorithm from [carrot2](https://github.com/carrot2/carrot2)

Also web-based interface is proposed to observe real-time clusters' fluctuations.
To simplify clusters presentation - [Masonry](http://masonry.desandro.com) javascript layout is used
