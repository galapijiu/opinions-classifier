opinions-classifier
===================

This is small attempt to create application which analyzes real-time stream of data (via twitter streaming API) and cluster different posts according to their meaning. It is planned to use for grouping tweets in real-time and to visualize trends in observed topic.

Various clustering algorithms are planned to be tested as part of this app.

See discussion on stackoverflow here: http://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/979/algorithms-for-text-clustering

One of the approaches is using Lingo algorithm from [carrot2](https://github.com/carrot2/carrot2)

Also web-based interface is proposed to observe real-time clusters' fluctuations.
To simplify clusters presentation - [Masonry](http://masonry.desandro.com) javascript layout is used
